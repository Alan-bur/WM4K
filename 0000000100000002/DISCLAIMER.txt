All textures included in this project were individually hand-drawn by me, Alan Burcet. I did not use any AI-generated content or automated upscaling tools in the creation of this project. Each texture has been redesigned from scratch, ensuring an original reinterpretation while maintaining the nostalgic essence of classic console interfaces.

This texture pack is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Nintendo in any way. It does not contain copyrighted assets, nor does it intend to infringe upon Nintendo’s intellectual property. The purpose of this project is purely artistic and for educational purposes, serving as a free-to-download resource for those who wish to enjoy a new visual experience.

🔹 This project and all previous versions are completely free. Support through Patreon and Ko-Fi helps fund ongoing development and may provide optional early access to the latest updates. The texture pack itself remains publicly available at no cost.
