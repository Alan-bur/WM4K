<h1>Wii Menu 4K Texture Pack</h1>
This project aims to prevent Wii Menu from pixelating on modern screens. It works for Dolphin Emulator only and it can't be loaded by a real Wii since this console does not support 4k Textures.

<h3>About</h3>
As this project was first released and published by "SuperDuperRob" on 2020, I started to focus on the missing details. I realised the "PM" and "AM" from the main menu clock were still pixelated, the tabs from the Data Management section were also pixelated, aswell as some buttons found in there. The Wii Message Boarde still needed some work. So... I can tell this was not a finished project.
Once i spotted and fixed these details, i redesigned the whole Wii Message Board since it was not that faithful to the Wii and the texture pack itself, designed the forgotten Wii setup and remade the Wii settings menu from scratch. I also had to upscale all the missing fonts so they all look good.

<h3>Known Bugs:</h3>
General <br>
<li> Fonts are a bit missplaced </li>
Wii System Settings <br>
<li> Console Nickname: Setting a custom name for the Wii makes that section lose 4K quality. Setting the nickname into "Wii" or "wii" would make it work. </li>
<li> Calendar: I won’t turn the “Date” and “Time” sections into 4K because i have to make each texture for each year, minute and hour and that would take a lot of time. </li>
<li> Internet: “Manual setup” and “Change settings” for Wireless Conection are also imposible to make because each section has a custom input and that means infinite textures. </li>
<li> Parental Controls: I had to remake the “Choose a question” section so that the questions are not clickable. This was made so i don’t have to turn non sense textures into 4K. </li>
<li> The secret question section is also not 4K (and it won’t be) because it requires input. <br>
