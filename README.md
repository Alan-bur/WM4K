<h1>Wii Menu 4K Texture Pack</h1>
This project was made to make the Wii Menu not to pixelate on modern screens. Nowadays works for Dolphin Emulator only and it can't be loaded by a real Wii since this console does not support 4k Textures.

<h3>Bugs:</h3>
- Widescreen button gets crazy when hovering on it. <br>
- Setting a custom name for the Wii makes that section lose 4K quality. Setting the nickname into "Wii" or "wii" would make it work. <br>
- Fonts are a bit missplaced <br>
