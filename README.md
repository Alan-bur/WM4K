<h1>Wii Menu 4K Texture Pack</h1>
This project was made to make the Wii Menu not to pixelate on modern screens. Nowadays works for Dolphin Emulator only and it can't be loaded by a real Wii since this console does not support 4k Textures.

First I focused on the missing details that i realised they were not changed.  the "PM" and "AM" from the main menu clock were still pixelated, the tabs from the Data Management section were also pixelated, aswell as some buttons found in there.
Then, i focused on the missing sections. i remade the Mail page since it was not that faithful to the Wii, designed the forgotten wii setup and remade the Wii settings menu from scratch. I also had to upscale all the missing fonts so they all look good.
<h3>Bugs:</h3>
- Widescreen button gets crazy when hovering on it. <br>
- Setting a custom name for the Wii makes that section lose 4K quality. Setting the nickname into "Wii" or "wii" would make it work. <br>
- Fonts are a bit missplaced <br>
