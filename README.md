## About
This project aims to prevent Wii Menu from pixelating on modern screens. It works for PC only and it can't be loaded by a real Wii since this console does not support 4k Textures. Originally published by [“SuperDuperRob”](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-hd-wii-menu-texture-pack) in 2019 as “HD Wii Texture Pack” I’ve got his permission to take over and complete the project as it was unfinished and forgotten. Everything has been remade and polished by hand with over 3000+ new textures so you can now enjoy exploring the Wii Menu on newer screens.

## Channel List
There are a lot of channels out there and decided to organize them [inside this excel sheet to keep the progress organized](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CwJun38H70kUvNCbsWNl7ZPuu7bygs59keiZNfTNVg4/edit?usp=sharing).<br>

## Known Bugs:

### Channels
- TV no Tomo Channel textures don’t fit very well making the lines and blocks not align correctly.
- Mario Kart Channel thumbnail has blue stars and they should be displayed as yellow.
- Riivolution needs a font change.
- Wii System Transfer and Wii U Transfer Tool characters are not 4K.

### Wii Menu
- Console Nickname: Setting a custom name for the Wii makes that section lose 4K quality. Setting the nickname into "Wii" or "wii" would make it work.
- Calendar: I won’t turn the “Date” and “Time” sections into 4K because i have to make each texture for each year, minute and hour and that would take a lot of time.
- Internet: “Manual setup” and “Change settings” for Wireless Conection are also imposible to make because each section has a custom input and that means infinite textures.
- Parental Controls: I had to remake the “Choose a question” section so that the questions are not clickable. This was made so i don’t have to turn non sense textures into 4K.
- The secret question section is also not 4K (and it won’t be) because it requires input.
- The "System has been corrupted" font is a bit missplaced
