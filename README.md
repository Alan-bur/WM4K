<h1>Wii Menu 4K Texture Pack</h1>
This project aims to prevent Wii Menu from pixelating on modern screens. It works for Dolphin Emulator only and it can't be loaded by a real Wii since this console does not support 4k Textures.

<h3>About</h3>
Originally published by “SuperDuperRob” in 2020 as “HD Wii Texture Pack,” I’ve taken over to complete the project as it was unfinished and forgotten. Everything has been remade and polished with over 3000+ new textures so you can now enjoy exploring the Wii Menu on newer screens.

<h3>Installation</h3>
<h4>Windows</h4>
1. Download the Wii Menu USA version. Go to Dolphin Launcher → Tools → Perform Online System Update → United States. Select it and then, click on “Yes”.<br>
2. Enable Auto-Adjust Window Size. Go to Dolphin Launcher → General.<br>
3. Enable Texture Dumping. Go to Dolphin Launcher → Graphics → Advanced.<br>
4. Enable Load Custom Textures and Prefetch Custom Textures. Go to Dolphin Launcher → Graphics → Advanced.<br>
5. Set Internal Resolution into 4k Native. Go to Dolphin Launcher → Graphics → Enhancements.<br>
6. Move the “0000000100000002” folder into C:\Users\your_user\AppData\Roaming\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures.<br>
7. Run the Wii Menu. Go to Dolphin Launcher → Tools → Load Wii System Menu 4.3U.<br>
<br>
<h4>Android</h4>
1. Download “0000000100000002.zip”<br>
2. Go to dolphin → Settings → User Data → Open User Data Folder → “≡”  → Downloads.<br>
3. Tap “0000000100000002.zip”  → Hold press “0000000100000002” → “⋮” → Extract to → Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures → Extract.<br>
4. Go to dolphin → “⋮” → “Load System Menu” → “Yes” → “USA”.<br>

6. Enable “Load Custom Textures” & “Prefetch Custom Textures”. Graphics Settings → Advanced.<br>

8. Tap “⋮” → “Load System Menu (4.3U)”.<br>
<h5>Android Tips</h5>
- Loading the Wii Menu while on vertical mode it will crash the Menu. To fix this all you gotta do is to rotate your phone first and then load the wii menu.<br>
- The Wii Cursor moves by touching the screen. If you don't see the cursor, all you gotta do is to flich the phone down a bit until it appears.<br>
- Delete the "0000000100000002.zip" folder because it's not necessary after finishing the installation. Hold press “0000000100000002.zip” → Delete.<br>

<h4>Extra Channels:</h4>

<h3>Known Bugs:</h3>

<h4>Channels</h4>
<li>TV no Tomo Channel textures don’t fit very well making the lines and blocks not align correctly.</li>
<li>Mario Kart Channel thumbnail has blue stars and they should be displayed as yellow.</li>
<li>Riivolution needs a font change.</li>
<li>Wii System Transfer and Wii U Transfer Tool characters are not 4K.</li>

<h4>Wii Menu</h4>
<li> Console Nickname: Setting a custom name for the Wii makes that section lose 4K quality. Setting the nickname into "Wii" or "wii" would make it work. </li>
<li> Calendar: I won’t turn the “Date” and “Time” sections into 4K because i have to make each texture for each year, minute and hour and that would take a lot of time. </li>
<li> Internet: “Manual setup” and “Change settings” for Wireless Conection are also imposible to make because each section has a custom input and that means infinite textures. </li>
<li> Parental Controls: I had to remake the “Choose a question” section so that the questions are not clickable. This was made so i don’t have to turn non sense textures into 4K. </li>
<li> The secret question section is also not 4K (and it won’t be) because it requires input. </li>
<li> Fonts are a bit missplaced </li>

<h4>Next update</h4>
On the new update i will be modifying and polishing these:
<li>WiiConnect24 Settings</li>
<li>Mario Kart Channel</li>
<li>Mii Channel</li>
<li>Wii Sports Resort</li>
